beholderGen
i enjoy lording my superiority over others
cold, emotionless logic is the way I defeat my foes
i determine if a creature is worth keeping alive within the first minute of speaking to it
i frequently dream of 
i pretend to be insaneso my enemies underestimate me
i am weary of frequent interruptions
assassination attempts are the only events that quell my feelings of loneliness
i sometimes fear that I am a flawed abomination
