beholderGen
my followers are all spying on me, and I seek motivated, powerful allies to destroy them
i miss the kinship of my identical twin, who disappeared years ago
i must recover an artifact that was stolen from me
i have foreseen the moment of my death and know what will kill me. I hope to curry favor with my slayer to forestall my end
i was lucky to escape my enemy, and I worry that I might be discovered again before I am ready
i scheme endlessly to recover an ancient tome that contains the secret of creating perfect, obedient clones of myself
