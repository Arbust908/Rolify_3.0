dragon
a place of magical power, a ley line that lets the dragon tap into raw magic
a place of elemental power
a portal between realms
skinned monsters in every hallway. The decorator has a macabre sense of style
a library of ancient tomes
a room of the dragon’s concubines of various races
puzzles that requires a dragon’s strength to operate
arcane traps
murals of the dragon’s personal conquests
a clutch of dragon eggs
illusions playing tricks on all that enter
scaly-skin molted all over the floors
a fake hoard filled with a sea of coin mimics
several holes in the roof through which the dragon can enter and exit while in flight
friendly inhabitants that live with the dragon
many statues and paintings of the dragon
maze-like corridors
puzzles that are easy if one understands Draconic
a huge chess set with pawns the size of people
the bones of one of the dragon’s parents
warding stones outside from several races warning of danger
a ghost bound to guard the lair and politely turn away invaders
a cloud of smoke and mist around it at all times
a huge pantry of all kinds of raw meats
an illusory dragon to bait enemy spells and attacks
strange music traveling throughout the whole lair
an alarming amount of mold and decay
strange and violent weather in its vicinity at all times
flooded caverns full of waterborne monsters
one huge chamber with pillars breaking it up
