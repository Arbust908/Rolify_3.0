its maker was killed to stop him from making a better weapon
it has fine metal work along the blade
it cannot be sheathed without tasting blood
it was tempered in an icy lake
it was forged in a volcano
it was forged with the fire of a dragon and tempered with the breath of a gigant
it is decorated with symbols where the shaft meets the blade
it was cooled in a full moons light
it can only be wielded by the pure of heart
it can only be wielded by the just
where the shaft meets the blade you find an enchanted
