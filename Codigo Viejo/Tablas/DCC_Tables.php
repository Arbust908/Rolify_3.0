Table 8-8: Sword Powers, Type II: Combat
Roll Power
01-05 Crippler. Always roll critical hits as warrior of one level higher than wielder.
06-10 Flame brand. Ignite in flame 3/day. Duration 6 rounds. Inflicts additional 1d6 damage and ignites targets on fire (Ref save to avoid; DC = 1d10+5).
11-15 Flame tongue. Launch jet of flame 1/day. Jet is cone, 40’ long and 10’ wide at end. All within take 2d6 damage and may catch on fire (Ref save to avoid; DC = 1d10+10).
16-20 Frostburn. Inflict additional 1d3 cold damage with every strike. Double damage to fire elementals.
21-24 Cleave. Each time an enemy is slain with this blade, the wielder automatically receive another attack (but cannot move). Note that certain bloodthirsty blades may attempt to force the wielder to attack an ally.
25-29 Vampiric touch. Any time the wielder inflicts 10 or more points of damage in a single strike, he heals 1 hit point.
30-32 Life drainer. The blade drains 1d4 XP with every blow, in addition to other damage.
33-37 Regenerator. When wielding this blade, the wielder’s natural rate of healing is doubled. In addition, the wielder recovers twice as many hit points as usual whenever a cleric lays hands upon him.
38-39 Energy mimic. When attacked by any form of energy attack (e.g., fire, cold, force, electricity, etc.), the wielder may attempt to capture the energy within the sword. Make an attack roll. (This is not actually an attack, but reflects the sword’s ability. Note that it does not prevent the wielder from taking damage; attempt saves as normal per the spell effect.) If the attack roll exceeds the spell check DC of the energy effect, the wielder captures that effect. He may unleash an identical effect as an attack action at some point within the next 24 hours. Once unleashed, the effect is lost. The sword only retains the most recent captured effect.
40-44 Shock blade. Inflict an additional 1d4 electrical damage with every strike, doubled to 2d4 if opponent wears metal armor, is in water, or is composed of metal (such as a golem or living statue).
45 Vorpal blade. On any critical hit, the wielder automatically decapitates enemy, causing instant death.
46-50 Thunder blade. In place of an attack, the wielder may strike the ground to create the resounding boom of thunder. All enemies within 40’ take 1d8 points of sonic damage (no save).
51-55 Eviscerator. When rolling damage, the wielder rolls an additional damage die every time he rolls the highest result on a die. For example, if this weapon is a long sword and the wielder rolls an “8” on the 1d8 damage roll, he then rolls another 1d8 and adds that to the damage result. If that second 1d8 produces another “8”, he rolls a third 1d8, and so on.
56-60 Medusa’s touch. A creature struck by this blade must make a Fort save (DC = 1d10+10) or be turned to stone permanently.
61-70 Great strength. Wielder’s Strength is increased by +4 while wielding blade.
71-75 Holy brand. Inflicts an additional +1d4 damage against unholy creatures.
76-81 Precise strike. Additional +1d4 bonus to attack rolls.
82-86 Whirlwind strike. Instead of making his normal attack, the wielder can make two attacks in a single round, but rolls 1d10 for each attack instead of 1d20. He applies his normal attack bonus. Critical hits are not possible when attacking in this manner.
87-91 Armor-breaker. On any critical hit, the opponent’s armor is destroyed, in addition to other effects.
92-96 Weapon-breaker. On any critical hit, the opponent’s weapon is destroyed, in addition to other effects. If the creature has natural weapons, they are maimed (e.g., claws are broken, teeth are shattered, etc.).
97-99 Throwing blade. Sword can be thrown up to 20’ to make a ranged attack. It always returns to its owner’s hand after a throw.
00 Roll again twice.

Table 8-9: Sword Powers, Type III: Magical
Roll Power
01-07 Spell healer. Wielder heals spellburn at 3x the normal rate: with no rest, heals 3 points of ability score loss each night, and with rest, heals 6 points each night.
08-14 Spellburn reservoir. Each day, the wielder can burn up to 3 points of the sword’s Intelligence on spellburn to affect his spellcasting as if he were spellburning his own abilities. The sword’s lost ability scores heal in full each night.
15-20 Spell magnifier. The wielder casts all spells at +1 caster level.
21-25 Shift planes. The wielder can shift to an adjacent plane 1/day, arriving in the position corresponding to his current position. There is a 10% chance that the sword also allows him to take along up to 1d4+1 allies with each plane shift.
26-30 Demon-binding. With any successful strike against a demon or other extraplanar creature, the target must make a DC 20 Will save or be bound to its current exact location for 1d4 turns. It cannot take any steps or teleport out unless this effect is magically dispelled.
31-39 Summon creature. The sword is magically keyed to a specific creature type (e.g., wolf, lion, pegasus, etc.). The wielder can summon such a creature 1d3 times per day.
40-51 Resistance. The sword grants its wielder resistance to certain forms of attack. The wielder ignores the first 3 points of damage from that form of attack each round, and gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against that form of damage. The form of attack is (roll 1d6) (1) fire, (2) cold, (3) acid, (4) lightning, (5) poison, (6) drowning.
52-58 Immune to non-magical attacks. The sword makes its wielder resistant to non-magical attacks. The wielder resists the first 5 points of damage each round by attacks of a non-magical nature. Creatures of 5+ HD are considered “magical” for purposes of this effect.
59-65 Resistance to critical hits. The sword makes the wielder hard to inflict critical damage upon. The wielder receives an automatic Fort save whenever a critical occurs against him. The DC is equal to the natural die roll used to score the crit (usually 20 but not always). If he makes this save, the critical does not take effect.
66-75 Flight. The wielder can fly at a speed of 30’.
76-84 Turn invisible. Up to 1d3 times per day, the wielder can turn invisible for a duration of 1d4 turns. The invisibility vanishes immediately if the wielder attacks.

95-97 Un-dead touch. The weapon scores critical hits as an un-dead creature, rolling 1d30 on crit table U whenever a crit is scored.
98-00 Regeneration. As long as he wields this weapon in his hand, the wielder regenerates 1 point of damage each round.

06-10 Amphibious. The dragon can breathe water and swim effortlessly.
11-15 Armored hide. The dragon’s AC is increased by an additional +4.
16-20 Barbed tail. The dragon receives an additional attack equivalent to a tail slap, which also causes poison damage (determine type from Appendix P).
21-25 Burrow. The dragon can “swim” through sand and dirt at its normal speed.
26-30 Damage reduction. The dragon’s tough hide reduces the damage of all blows against it by 1d4 points (roll at time of creation).

36-40 Fast reflexes. The dragon’s Ref save is increased by an additional +4.
41-45 Frightful presence. The dragon’s visage and sheer mass are absolutely terrifying. All who look upon it must make a Will save (DC 10+HD) or flee in terror (duration 1d4 turns or until reach a safe distance).
46-50 Hurl rocks. The dragon can use its claws to pick up and throw small boulders. The attack requires one action die and is treated as missile fire at the same attack bonus with a range of 100’ for average size dragons, 200’ for large dragons, and 300’ for godlike dragons. The hurled stone does 1d12 damage.
51-55 Hypnotic stare. The dragon can hypnotize targets with its gaze. The dragon can gaze into the eyes of one target per round by using one action die. A creature that meets the dragon’s gaze must make a Will save (DC 10+HD) or stand stupefied as long as the dragon holds its gaze.
56-60 Immunity. The dragon is immune to (roll 1d12) (1) poison, (2) fire, (3) cold, (4) electricity, (5) arrows and bolts, (6) curses, (7) paralysis, (8) sleep, (9) gas, (10) suffocation, (11) force attacks (i.e., magic missile), (12) sonic attacks.
61-65 Infravision 100’
66-70 Magic resistance. All spells cast against dragon subject to 50% chance of failure before saves are rolled.
71-75 Petrifying gaze. The dragon can petrify targets with its gaze. The dragon can gaze into the eyes of one target per round by using one action die. A creature that meets the dragon’s gaze must make a Will save (DC 10+HD) or be permanently changed to stone.

81-85 Rusting hide. The dragon’s hide causes rust in all normal metal objects. As a result, its treasure horde consists primarily of gems and magical items. Weapons used to attack the dragon crumble to rust upon touch (although magic weapons are immune).
86-90 Snatch attack. On a successful claw attack, the dragon snatches a target. The dragon can snatch up to one target per claw attack and cannot make the corresponding claw attack while a creature is snatched. A snatched creature takes 1d6 crushing damage each round. The dragon can fly with snatched creatures and can drop the grabbed target from any height, causing 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen. Snatched creatures can attempt to escape with a Strength check (DC of 10 + dragon’s HD).
91-95 Throw spines. The dragon’s hide is filled with barbed spines that can be hurled as an attack. This takes the place of one claw attack, and the attack is made at the same attack and damage roll with a range of 100’. A dragon has enough ammunition to throw up to 4 spine attacks per day.
96-100 Weapon-resistant hide. The dragon’s armor is so thick that it takes half damage from mundane weapons. Magical weapons do normal damage.

67-69 Reverse gravity (1/day). The dragon can reverse gravity in an area 100’ surrounding itself. The dragon itself is not affected, but all other creatures “fall” upward, suffering falling damage of 1d6 per 10’ fallen if they hit a ceiling.
